Provide a comprehensive analysis of task **$ARGUMENTS** from TODO.md.

## Instructions

1. Find the task in `/TODO.md` by searching for the task ID (e.g., T001, T002)
2. Read both the Task Index entry and the detailed description section
3. Look at related tasks in the same Sprint or category
4. Examine existing similar implementations in the codebase for patterns
5. Do NOT assume knowledge - explain all business concepts and terminology

## Context: TripCraft

TripCraft is an AI-powered travel itinerary generation platform that creates customized, color-coded holiday schedules using Claude AI. Users enter trip preferences (destination, dates, interests, budget) and the app generates complete trip plans with a color-coded calendar grid, day-by-day walkthrough, food guide, money/budget tips, language phrases, culture & etiquette, and logistics. Users can interactively edit itineraries with drag-and-drop, export to Excel/PDF, share via public links, and book through affiliate partners. The main lifecycle is: onboard profile preferences → create trip → generate itinerary → edit/customize → export/share → book via affiliates.
